# Architecture Decision Record (ADR) Example repo

This is an example repo showing how ADRs can be used. ADRs are described [in this article by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions), and were also recommended at *Adopt* in the November 2017 [Thoughtworks Tech Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/lightweight-architecture-decision-records).

ADRs are a lightweight way to document architectural decisions, and is especially suited for an approach of evolutionary architecture. This is beneficial to those new to the archtitecture and also provides a way to look back and undertand the hostory of architectural decisions. 

## Tooling

The examples in this repo were created using Nat Pryce's [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) which provide a simple way to create the decision documents and see the timeline. As they are created as [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) documents they play beautifully with GitHub.
